Deliverables:

1. Three metrics from the data set which are interesting
2. Given an address and time, what is the most likely dispatch to be required?
3. Which areas take the longest time to dispatch to on average? How can this be reduced?

Potential questions...

1. Types of calls per battalion?
2. Longest type of call to dispatch per battalion?
3. Amount of calls per battalion?
